# Gene Methylation Impact Analysis

This project analyzes the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression. It utilizes data from public databases and employs bioinformatics tools to identify and predict which genes are influenced by methylation patterns.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ConticTech/Kiddko-Experiment
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Kiddko-Experiment
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```

The script will execute and provide output based on the analysis of gene methylation and its effects.

### Output

The program will output the following:

- A list of genes and their associated SNPs.
- The ancestral allele for each SNP.
- A complete list of genotype variations.
- The predicted impact of methylation on each gene's expression.
